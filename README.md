# github-template-default

This is a very basic template for when creating a Github repository. 

Things to start with are

* setup [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)
* setup and fix default [workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows)
* setup [dependabot](https://playbook.internal.coop/platforms/cloud_platform/dev_build_deploy/github/guide_github_dependabot.html)
